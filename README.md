dmenu-startup
=============

The main reason for this repository is to save scripts of programs I use together with dmenu.

For each of this scripts I have created a symbolic link, so dmenu can start them like applications:
# ln /home/etienne/scripts/calendar /usr/bin/calendar -s

ATTENTION: In the radiostation there is a hard-coded link to my home folder.
